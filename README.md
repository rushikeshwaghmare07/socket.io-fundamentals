# Socket.io

**Socket.IO** - is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, **bidirectional** communication 
between web clients (browsers) and servers. It simplifies the process of building interactive 
web applications by allowing data to be transmitted instantly and continuously between the client and 
server, facilitating features like chat applications, live updates and multiplayer gaming.


## Bidirectional Communication

**Bidirectional communication** means that information can flow in **two directional**, both the
web client (browser) and the server can send and receive data to and from each other in real-time.
So, if something changes on the server, it can immediately notify the client and vice versa, 
without the client needing to constantly ask the server id there's new information available.

## Analogy

Think of bidirectional communication like a phone call. When you're talking on the phone with someone,
you can both speak and listen at the same time. It's not just one person talking while the other listens,
both parties can exchange information back and forth. Similarly, with bidirectional communication
in **Socket.IO** both the web client and the server can send and receive data, creating a two-way flow
of information like a conversation on the phone.
